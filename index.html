            <h2>About Tibetan Astrology</h2>
            <p>Tibetan astrology (Tsi) is a complex system that blends indigenous Tibetan practices with elements from Chinese and Indian traditions. While many people identify their animal sign based on the Western calendar year, traditional Tibetan astrology depends on the Tibetan lunar calendar, which begins with Losar (Tibetan New Year), usually occurring in February or March.</p>
            <p>This means that people born in January or February might actually belong to the previous year's animal sign according to Tibetan tradition. This calculator takes the Losar dates into account to determine your true Tibetan astrological sign.</p>
            <p>Each animal sign is also associated with one of the five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal/Iron, Water), creating a 60-year cycle. Your element and animal combination provides deeper insights into your personality, strengths, and challenges.</p>
